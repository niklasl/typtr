# TypTr

A transpiler for an idiomatic subset of typed Python into semantically similar
object-oriented languages.

## Installation

To keep up with ongoing development, clone this repo and run `pip install -e .`
within it.

## Dependencies

[Mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) is recommended while working on a
transpilable code base.

## Supported Features

TypTr was originally a part of [TRLD](https://github.com/niklasl/trld). The
needs of that project pretty much dictates what features and idioms are
supported by TypTr at this point.
